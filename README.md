# remoteAudio
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dh1tw/remoteAudio.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dh1tw/remoteAudio)

remoteAudio is an audio streaming application, built for Amateur Radio purposes,
written in [Go](1). The most typical use case for this software is the remote
operation of an amateur radio station.

**ADVICE**: This project is **under development**. The parameters, ICD and the
behaviour is still **not stable** and subject to change.

## Supported Codecs

- [OPUS](2) (default)
- PCM (variable samplerate and 8/12/16/24 bit depth)

## Supported Transportation Protocols

- [MQTT](3)
- P2P protocol (UDP/TCP/ZEROMQ) will be added later

## Supported Platforms

RemoteAudio has been tested on the following platforms:

- AMD64
- i386
- ARMv6
- ARMv8

and the following operating Systems:

- Linux (Ubuntu, Raspian)
- MacOS (Sierra)

## How build remoteAudio from source on Linux (Ubuntu > 12.04)

### Dependencies

1. Make sure you have the latest [Go][5] version installed 
2. Download and install the latest version of the [Protocol buffers compiler][6]
3. Install ````pkg-config```, ```libsamplerate``` and ```libopus```

```bash

    $ sudo apt install pkg-config libsamplerate0 libsamplerate0-dev libopusfile-dev libopus-dev libportaudio2 portaudio19-dev

```

3. Install the gogo protocol buffers plugin

```bash

    $ go get github.com/gogo/protobuf/protoc-gen-gofast

```

4. Download the remoteAudio sources and the packages it depends on

```bash

    $ go get -d github.com/dh1tw/remoteAudio

```

5. Build remoteAudio

```bash

    $ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/dh1tw/remoteAudio
    $ make build

```

6. Install remoteAudio on your Systems

```bash

    $ make install

```

## Requirements

In order to operate remoteAudio you need to either run your own MQTT Broker
([Mosquitto](4) is a good choice) or connect to a public broker, like
`iot.eclipse.org` or `test.mosquitto.org`. The load of these brokers
and their ping to your place obviously will influence the latency. These public
brokers are good for inital tests, however they are sometimes overloaded.

## Execute Audio Server

```bash

    $ remoteAudio server mqtt

```

## Execute Audio Client

```bash

    $ remoteAudio client mqtt

```

## List audio devices
If you are not sure about the name of your audio devices and their parameters,
you can easily list that information:

```bash

    $ remoteAudio enumerate

```


Both, the server and the client provide extensive configuration possibilities,
either through a configuration file (TOML|YAML|JSON), typically located in
your home directory `/home/your_user/.remoteAudio.toml`. or through pflags.

An example configuration file is included in the repository.

All parameters can be set through pflags. The following *example* shows the
options for ```$ remoteAudio server mqtt --help```:

```

The Client provides a minimal Web Interface for basic control of the
client and server side audio streams. Open a Webbrowser at:
[http://localhost:6060](https://localhost:6060) to access the WebUI.

![Alt text](ScreenshotWebUI.png?raw=true "Screenshot remoteAudio WebUI")

In any case, the client and server will accept almost any kind of audio frames
without any configuration. Internally remoteAudio picks the right codec,
resamples and adjust to the local audio output device.

However if the buffer size does not correspond to the internal buffer size,
the stream has to be restarted which might result in a small delay.

## Troubleshooting

remoteAudio does it's best to check if your sound hardware is compatible with
the parameters you have set. However it's not entirely possible to check all
the Settings.

Inexpensive (USB) Soundcards usually operate at 48kHz. They play the audio in
Stereo and Record the Audio in MONO.
